specifications:

Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type. 
*** use event.key and onkeyup to listen for letters that the player will type

Display the following on the page:

Press any key to get started!
*** first keystroke will trigger the start of the game

Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
***add to win counter everytime the word is guessed correctly, var wins=0;

If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.
***find a way to display the word, or have it be replaced by the letter. or maybe revealed?
create an array with all the possible guesses, and use var rf = Math.floor(Math.random()*3);
console.log(rf); or a variation to pick a random element in the array

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
***subtract from guess counter, var remainingGuesses=12;

Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
***user input from event.key or onkeyup will be stored in a variable guess, and displayed on the screen

After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
***find a way to either loop the program, or have it reset automatically after remainingGuesses=0 or the value of wins is increased?
maybe add another variable which is called victory, and when victory = true the game resets

Hangman Game Bonuses

Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
***find a way to imbed a song, which only plays if the user wins
Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before,
but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.
Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
Definitely talk with a TA or your instructor if you get tripped up during this challenge.
